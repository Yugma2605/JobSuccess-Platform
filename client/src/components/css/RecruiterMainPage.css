/* 
Width: 100%
Defines a fixed width: Sets the element's width to 100% of its parent container's width.
Ignores available space: Doesn't consider the available space within the container. If other elements are present, it will overflow or cause layout issues.
Suitable for: Simple layouts where an element should always fill the entire width of its parent.


Flex-Grow: 1
Distributes available space: Tells the element to grow to fill any extra available space within the flex container. Â  
Considers other flex items: Shares the remaining space proportionally with other flex items with the same or higher flex-grow value.
Suitable for: Flexible layouts where elements should adapt to different screen sizes and content changes. */
